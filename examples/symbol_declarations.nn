## Inferring function usage based on return type.

fn random<T>
    when <int>(): int -> randi()
    when <float>(): float -> randf()

const a : float = random()
const b : int = random()

## This is so damn cursed.

fn new<T> -> return T();

const p : Person = Person()

# could be written as

const p2 : Person = new()
